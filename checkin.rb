# checkin - a tool to integrate mindful checkins into your git workflow
# Wording, advice, and structure for this mindfulness exercise were largely pulled from "SOS for Emotions" by the NYU Student Health Center, authored by Reji Mathew, PhD, NYU Counseling and Wellness Services, Dialectical Behavior Therapy Clinical Team (https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/studentHealthServices/documents/PDFs/mental-health/CWS_SOS_for_Emotions_Booklet.pdf).
# To use this program, call it without arguments. If you call it with the argument 'log', you can get a report on your previous checkins.

# features to add:
# - retrieve notes to self?
# - retrieve a report of emotions, intensity, etc.
