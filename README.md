# checkin-project

checkin - a tool to integrate mindful checkins into your git workflow

Wording, advice, and structure for this mindfulness exercise were largely pulled from 'SOS for Emotions' by the NYU Student Health Center, authored by Reji Mathew, PhD, NYU Counseling and Wellness Services, Dialectical Behavior Therapy Clinical Team (https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/studentHealthServices/documents/PDFs/mental-health/CWS_SOS_for_Emotions_Booklet.pdf).

This program is designed to be used when you checkout a git branch, so that you can checkin with yourself before you start on some coding work. If you're feeling somewhat to very intense negative emotions, you're encouraged to address those before you start your work, and leave a note to yourself to be reviewed later.

This program has three optional arguments:

- help, h, --help, or --h

  - Displays this help screen.

- log, or l, with optional integer

  - Displays a chronological table of all of your previous checkins. Include an integer n to limit the checkins to the previous n, by date.

- pull, or p

  - Review your previous notes to self made through this program.
